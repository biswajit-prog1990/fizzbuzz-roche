--------------------------
Fizz Buzz REST Server
--------------------------
Objective:
--------------
Implement a robust and production-ready Fizz-Buzz REST Server that follows the classic Fizz-Buzz logic.
The server should expose a REST API endpoint, with the additional feature of a statistical endpoint.

Fizz-Buzz Logic
-------------------
The Fizz-Buzz algorithm involves replacing all multiples of 3 with "fizz", all multiples of 5 with "buzz" and
all multiples of 15 with "fizzbuzz". Your output should look like this:

Example: â€œ1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,..."
Requirements
Your server should adhere to the following specifications:

1. REST API Endpoint
-----------------------------
Accept five parameters: three integers (int1, int2, and limit) and two strings (str1 and str2).
Return a list of strings containing numbers from 1 to limit.
Replace multiples of int1 with str1, multiples of int2 with str2, and multiples of both int1 and int2 with str1str2

/v1/fizzbuzz?_int1=&_int2=&_limit=&_str1=&_str2=
Output - Generates the values as per FizzBuzz Logic

2. Production Ready
-----------------------------
Ensure that the server is ready for production use.
Prioritize clean and maintainable code to facilitate future development by other developers.

Actuators added - all endpoints included except env, beans

3. Statistics Endpoint:
------------------------------
Add a statistics endpoint that accepts no parameters.
Return the parameters corresponding to the most used request.
Include the number of hits for the most frequent request.

/v1/statistics - endpoint to get the most called request

4. Unit Tests:
-----------------------------
Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of your server.

Added all the unit tests necessary for validations under src/test folder

5. API Documentation:
-----------------------------
Accessible at localhost:8080/api-docs or localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

6. Build Instruction:
-----------------------------
In-mem db H2 provided, console can be accessed at localhost:8080/h2-console
To create build jar - run mvn clean compile install package
Table name - Statistics
